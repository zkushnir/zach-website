    <h1>Projects</h1>
    <p class="muted">Selected work in robotics, materials, and assistive technology.</p>

    <h2>Hand Exoskeleton for Motor Recovery</h2>
    <p>
      Graduate research in CMU’s NeuroMechatronics Lab. I design, prototype, and test a 3D-printed hand exoskeleton
      intended to improve motor function after stroke and spinal cord injury. The work spans mechanism design,
      actuation, and EMG-informed control strategies, with the long-term goal of clinical deployment.
    </p>

    <h2>Mechano-Activated Shape-Morphing Laminates</h2>
    <p>
      Research on thin aluminum–plastic laminate composites that can morph shape when mechanically activated,
      supporting applications like deployable structures and adaptive surfaces. My contributions include experimental
      characterization and analysis of deformation and failure behavior, leading to a co-authored publication in
      Advanced Engineering Materials.
    </p>

    <h2>Acutronic Co-op – High-Precision Motion Systems</h2>
    <p>
      As a mechanical engineering co-op at Acutronic, I worked on multi-axis, high-speed rotational systems used
      to test missiles and other aerospace systems. I designed precision components, created manufacturing drawings,
      and performed load-verification and wobble tests on custom motion platforms to meet tight performance specs.
    </p>

    <h2>Automatic Jar Opener</h2>
    <p>
      A powered jar-opening device designed to make everyday tasks more accessible. I handled mechanical design,
      prototyping, and iteration, focusing on torque transmission, ergonomics, and reliability across different jar
      sizes and lid geometries.
    </p>

    <h2>Machine Learning Projects</h2>
    <p>
      A set of projects built while teaching and taking introductory machine learning courses. Topics include:
    </p>
    <ul class="link-list">
      <li>Implementing a feedforward neural network with backpropagation and regularization</li>
      <li>PCA-based facial recognition with SVM and k-NN classifiers</li>
      <li>K-means clustering for image color quantization</li>
      <li>Regularization studies comparing training vs. test error across hyperparameters</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>“Zachatronic” Turn Signal</h2>
    <p>
      A custom embedded system project (“Zachatronic” turn signal) combining microcontrollers, simple electronics,
      and mechanical fixtures to create a more expressive, visible signaling system for cyclists or personal mobility.
