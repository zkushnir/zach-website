    <h1>About</h1>
    <p class="muted">Background, education, and skills.</p>

    <p>
      I grew up in Syracuse, NY and first got hooked on engineering in high school through design-and-build courses
      where I could turn ideas into physical things. That curiosity — “how far can I push what I can design and build?” —
      eventually led me to Pittsburgh.
    </p>

    <p>
      I completed my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering at the University of Pittsburgh, where I cycled between
      co-op rotations at Acutronic, research in soft and morphing materials, and teaching first-year engineering
      students. Those experiences narrowed my interests toward robotics and human–machine systems.
    </p>

    <p>
      I’m now pursuing my M.S. in Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, specializing in robotics.
      In the NeuroMechatronics Lab, I design and prototype a hand exoskeleton aimed at restoring motor function
      for people after stroke and spinal cord injury, blending mechanics, actuation, and EMG-based control.
    </p>

    <p>
      In parallel, I continue to train and compete in Olympic-style karate as a member of Team USA. The combination
      of high-level sport and research shapes how I work: structured, intense, and focused on long-term progress.
    </p>
